Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good! on Kindle
===============================================
These are the sources that I used to generate [Fred Hebert's book][1] in the
Kindle-supported .mobi format.

If you only want the book, just download the [mobi file][3] from my web site
(last generated on April 10th, 2014). Please note that I'm not updating the .mobi
file periodically, and that's why you may want to generate the book by yourself.


How to Generate the Book
------------------------
1. Make sure you're connected to the Internet. The ebook will be generated using
the latest content on the website.
2. Make sure you have PHP >= 5.3 installed and the executable is on PATH.
3. Download [KindleGen][2] and make sure the executable is on PATH.
4. Run: `$ make`
5. Load build/learn-you-some-erlang.mobi on your Kindle device or test it with
the [Kindle Previewer tool][2].
